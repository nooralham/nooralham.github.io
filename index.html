									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/11.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Although Al-Saj restuarant had a website, they felt it was out of date and needed a complete redesign. The colour scheme was changed and the new design that I made was more attractive, as well as having creative features such as large responsive banners of food, service boxes and a 'meet our team' banner to see the chefs who work at Al-Saj restaurant. A social media feed was also inputed upon the footer of the site to keep customers up to date with the latest news and offers. The mock up of this web was designed in html5, css3 and Bootstrap framework.</p>
